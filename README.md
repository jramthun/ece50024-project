# An Expansion on Learning to Reweight Examples for Robust Deep Learning: Exploring Online Autodifferentiation for Class Imbalance Problems
> By: John Ramthun - Purdue ECE 50024

This work is a reimplementation and continuation of [Learning to Reweight Examples for Robust Deep Learning](https://github.com/uber-research/learning-to-reweight-examples).
This implementation uses [PyTorch Lightning](https://lightning.ai). Other dependencies include numpy, itertools, and torchvision.
